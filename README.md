# Java Sandbox

Getting back into practicing Java after not touching it for a few years.

Plan:

- a few `starters` projects
- likely use it to tackle `hackerrank` and `leetcode` questions and save
solutions here
- Add a popular Java framework subfolder to create a basic web project
    - Likely Spring Boot since I've used it in the past, but will research
    Java framework market shares before deciding.

## Structure
This repo DOES NOT use its root as a project root. To be able to effectively
keep many separate code challenges and mini-projects in the same repo, there
will be multiple project roots.

Project Roots:
- `starters`

Beyond that, check package declarations to determine project roots.
If that doesn't work, something is likely broken.
